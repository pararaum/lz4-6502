# lz4-6502

The original Peter Ferrie's pages containing the LZ4 decompressor for
the 6502 have vanished. This is a copy containing the 6502 and the
65C02 code for decompressing LZ4 streams.

This is a (more or less) faithful copy of https://web.archive.org/web/20171220012141/http://pferrie.host22.com/misc/appleii.htm.
